		<p>My name is Bundy Manriquez, I am 30 years old and I was born in Salinas, California. Before I turned one year old, I moved to Texas and have been here ever since. I graduated high school in 2008 from Blanco High School. I lived in Blanco, Texas for about 18 years. We then moved to Spring Branch, Texas and I lived there for about 8 years. When I was 21, I got a job as a surveyor for a consultant company called M & S Engineering. I worked as a surveyor for about two years and then got moved to the distribution side of the company. Now I am a project manager and am currently going on 10 years working for this company.  I owe this company everything, without I do not know where I would be right now. I am sure I would not have been able to start college again and start learning a new career. I am currently enrolled at Northwest Vista College in San Antonio and I am majoring in Digital Arts and Media. I know I have always wanted to work with computers or on computers. One day I just researched coding and how a website was built and did some coding for myself and found it very pleasing and fun. From then on, I have not stopped learning about website creation and coding and canâ€™t wait to do it for a living.
